# Tims-Diner
This was originally a 20 hour coding project assigned to my computer science class, however Corona came and well, I decided to make this a starter app for any language i learn.
As of the newest commit (08/09/2020) this project has been done in the following lanuages:

  1.Python
  2.Java
  3.Visual Csharp

All the programs are of varying complexity and cannot achieve the same thing as one another, as i was learning differnt libraries, syntax and (in java/cs's case-OOP)
